# Running the React JS App Locally

To get the app up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js**: Ensure that you have Node.js version 20.4.0 installed.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` from the root directory of the application to install all required packages.
3. **Start the Application**: Execute `npm run dev` to launch the app. It will be available at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/).

## Challenges Overview

### Challenge I
- **Dynamic Scoring Display**: Based on the user's selections from the dropdown menus for `Bowl`, `Shot`, and `Timing`, the corresponding runs scored will be displayed dynamically.

### Challenge II
- **Commentary Integration**: Alongside the displayed runs, commentary will also appear, which varies randomly based on the outcome. For example, commentary for a six-run score may vary, pulling from a predefined data set.

### Challenge III
- **Super Over Simulation**: Given the scenario where the `TARGET` is 21 runs, `WICKETS_IN_HAND` are 2, and `BOWL` count is 6, users can simulate and determine the outcome of India's performance based on their selection combinations in the application.
